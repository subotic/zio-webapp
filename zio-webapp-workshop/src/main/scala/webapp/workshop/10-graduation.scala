  /**
   * EXERCISE
   *
   * It's now time to begin your graduation project!!!
   *
   * Edit the `zio-webapp-core` project, which contains scaffolding for a simple
   * web application.
   *
   * The project is loaded with all the same dependencies as the workshop, so
   * you are free to use any of the libraries introduced in the workshop.
   *
   * For bonus points, construct a simple front-end that can generate requests
   * for your web server and handle responses.
